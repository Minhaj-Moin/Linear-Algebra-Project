# Linear-Algebra-Project
Creating the illusion of 3D without using a graphics library.  Basically writing code for graphics at a lower level. Application of Concepts that we learnt in our Linear Algebra Course.

## Compiling
This uses and has been tested only on MinGW. Make relevant changes to the Makefile to include your SDL Libraries, then type '''mingw32-make.exe''' to compile.
